    <h2>Get To Know Us! </h2>
        The company was founded by five computer science students
        that all had one thing in common; being bookworms. 
        All they needed to please their endless love for books was
        a forum that gave them the possibility to buy books safely 
        and effectively online without going through the trouble of 
        leaving the house. As a result, the team gathered and began 
        a project that later was going to evolve to be the biggest
        online bookstore in the world, called The Book Cave.
